# Install Dependence
All dependence are included in `Pipfile` so you can use one of `Anaconda`, `pipenv` or `virtualenv` to build the environment to run this program.  
For example, I will show you how to use `pipenv` to build the environment.  
## Step 1: Install `pipenv` if you haven't installed it yet.  
```
pip install pipenv
```
## Step 2: Install dependence and activate environment.  
Make sure you are in the home directory of this project.
```
pipenv install
```
```
pipenv shell
```
If there's no accident, you are ready to run this program.
# Run
Make sure you have finished the former steps.
```
python PSO3DViews.py
```
# Enjoy
